## Installing 

| Distro        | Link                      |
| ---------     | ------------------------- |
| Debian Linux | 10,000/month |
| Arch Linux (AUR) | [ipmap-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ipmap-git/) |


## Building From Scratch

### Requirements 
ipmap uses `libpcap-dev`, which is only easily available on UNIX-like systems (Linux, MacOS, *BSD).

On **Linux**, you *must* have `libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev` to build and run.

Windows is possible, but [WinPcap](https://github.com/ebfull/pcap#windows) is required before build time.

Because this program is written in rust, you must have rust [installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Compiling
First, build it:
```
$ make
```

Then, you can install it.
```
# make install
```
*Note: "#" means run as root. This means either through the root user or sudo*

**To use it navigate to your web browser and go to `localhost:700`, where the map will appear.**

## Services
The IP geolocation service used in ipmap can be changed at the start using the command line flag.

Each service included in this library has a weekly, hourly, or monthly limit.
Some have more free queries, but are less reliable.

Here are the query limits:

| Service       | Limit                     | Site          |
| ---------     | ------------------------- | ------------- |
| ipwhois       | 10,000/month              | ipwhois.app   |
| freegeoip     | 15,000/hour               | freegeoip.app |
| ipapi         | 45/minute                 | ip-api.com    |
| ipapico       | 1,000/day (30,000/month)  | ipapi.co      |

If no service specified, ipapi will be used, which will limit how many IP is detected per minute.

## Creating Debian Packages
Creating debian packages is fairly easy, as I've created a makefile for it.

Dependencies:
```
# apt install build-essential devscripts debhelper libpcap-dev
```

Then just type:
```
make deb-gen
```
