# IP-Geolocation Dataset Parser/Datastructures

Datasets can be downloaded at [`sapics/ip-location`](https://github.com/sapics/ip-location-db?tab=readme-ov-file#city) under the "City" section.

They are labeled `(ipdb/geolite2)-city-ipv(4/6)[-num].csv[.gz]` depending on the format. The "ipv4/6-num" ones are smaller/faster to parse, but not human-readable.
